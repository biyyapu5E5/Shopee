# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

***Absolute Units***:

1) **Pixels (px)**: A pixel is the smallest unit of
measurement in CSS, it is defined as 1/96 of an inch.

    96px=1inch

2) **Centimeters (cm)**: Centimeters are a metric unit of
length used to represent physical lengths.





***Relative Units***:

1) **Percentage (%)**: Percentages are relative to the parent
element's size or the viewport dimensions. For example, setting
width: 50% on an element makes it 50% of the width of its
containing block.

2) **Em (em)**: An em is equal to the computed font-size of an
element's parent. For example, if the font-size of the parent
element is 16px then 1em is equal to 16px.

3) **Rem (rem)**: Rem units are similar to em units, but
they are relative to the root element (html) rather than
the parent element.

4) **Viewport Width (vw)**: Viewport width units represent
a percentage of the viewport's width. For example, 1vw is
equal to 1% of the viewport's width.
    Vw: relative to 1% of viewport width

    **Viewport Height (vh)**: Viewport height units represent a
percentage of the viewport's height. For example, 1vh is equal
to 1% of the viewport's height.
    Vh: relative to 1% of viewport height.
